# Project report

### Project's goal

In this environment called Reacher, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal the agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible. Additional information can be found [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher).
